# iris-flower-classification

This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies iris flowers into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. It utilizes the classic Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 flowers.


Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the Iris dataset from a CSV file.
Visualize the data distribution to understand its characteristics.
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Data Preprocessing:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Standardize the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Model Training:

Select a suitable machine learning algorithm for classification.
Train the model using the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Selection and Tuning:

Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors) to find the best-performing model.
Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search.
